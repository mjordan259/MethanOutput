Analysis and write-up, originally produced as part of application to WattTime

This analysis was originally created using data and a precis from WattTime, as part of their application process. 

Jordan_blog_entry.pdf is the final product, and contains both visualizations and a write-up of findings. The .ipynb files provide a look at my thought processes and how I went about analyzing the data and extracting insights.

My thanks to WattTime for the interesting project, and permission to post the outcome publicly.
